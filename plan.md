# Crypto Market Analysis Agent System

## Overview
This project implements a multi-agent system for crypto market analysis and trading using the OpenAI Agents SDK. The system connects to various cryptocurrency exchanges via the CCXT library to analyze market data, identify trading opportunities, and execute trades based on configurable strategies.

## System Components

### 1. Main Orchestration Agent
- Acts as the central coordinator and entry point for user interactions
- Routes requests to specialized sub-agents based on user queries and market conditions
- Synthesizes insights from multiple sub-agents to provide comprehensive responses
- Manages handoffs between agents and ensures coherent user experience

### 2. Specialized Sub-Agents

#### Orderbook Analysis Agent
- Analyzes market depth and liquidity
- Identifies significant buy/sell walls and potential support/resistance levels
- Detects market imbalances and potential price manipulation
- Provides insights on market microstructure

#### Technical Analysis Agent
- Performs traditional and advanced technical analysis on price data
- Calculates indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- Identifies chart patterns and potential breakouts/breakdowns
- Provides trend analysis and support/resistance levels

#### Trading Opportunity Agent
- Combines insights from other agents to identify trading opportunities
- Evaluates risk/reward ratios for potential trades
- Generates trading signals with entry, exit, and stop-loss levels
- Monitors active trades and suggests position management strategies

#### Market Sentiment Agent
- Analyzes market sentiment from various sources
- Tracks social media and news sentiment for specific cryptocurrencies
- Monitors on-chain metrics and whale activity
- Provides insights on overall market psychology

#### Risk Management Agent
- Evaluates portfolio risk and suggests position sizing
- Monitors correlations between assets
- Provides risk metrics for potential and existing positions
- Suggests hedging strategies during high volatility

### 3. Core Infrastructure

#### Exchange Connectivity Layer
- Manages connections to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges via CCXT
- Handles API rate limiting and error handling
- Standardizes data formats across different exchanges
- Implements retry and fallback mechanisms

#### Data Processing Pipeline
- Collects and normalizes market data from various sources
- Performs data cleaning and preprocessing
- Implements efficient caching mechanisms
- Handles different timeframes and data aggregation

#### Trading Execution Module
- Executes trades based on signals from the Trading Opportunity Agent
- Manages order types (limit, market, stop, etc.)
- Implements smart order routing for best execution
- Provides execution reports and trade history

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- Set up project structure and dependencies

- Create user-friendly interface and documentation

## Progress Update

As of March 2025, we have successfully implemented:

1. The complete agent architecture with all specialized agents:
   - Main Orchestration Agent for coordinating all specialized agents
   - Orderbook Analysis Agent for analyzing market depth and liquidity
   - Technical Analysis Agent for performing technical analysis on price data
   - Trading Opportunity Agent for identifying potential trading signals
   - Market Sentiment Agent for analyzing sentiment from various sources
   - Risk Management Agent for evaluating portfolio risk and position sizing

2. Core infrastructure components:
   - Exchange connectivity layer using CCXT
   - Basic data processing pipeline
   - Handoff mechanisms between agents

Next steps include:
- Enhancing the data processing pipeline for more advanced analysis
- Implementing complete trading signal generation
- Testing the system with real market data
- Developing the trading execution module

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Agent Framework**: OpenAI Agents SDK
- **Exchange Connectivity**: CCXT Library
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas, TA-Lib
- **Machine Learning** (future): PyTorch/TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- **API**: FastAPI for RESTful endpoints

## Security Considerations

- API keys stored securely using environment variables and encryption
- Rate limiting for API requests to prevent overuse
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

## Deployment Strategy

- Docker containerization for consistent environments
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Monitoring and alerting system for performance and errors
- Horizontal scaling for handling increased load
